# ArmyBootcamp
A java program to manage an army bootcamp.

Project Statement
Our project is a program that implements different data structures to create an army boot camp system. This system can be used by army recruiters to add recruits, remove recruits, and check if recruits have passed specific requirements to be eligible to start the bootcamp then to join the army. To achieve a perfectly working system, we applied multiple concepts taken throughout the course in Java.
